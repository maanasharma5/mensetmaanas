**Yesterday**, I was on a coffee chat with a friend in SBC [^1] and she asked me about why I joined. The details of my actual answer are slightly irrelevant -- though they may make an appearance on this website at some point or another -- but I somehow ended up talking about how much I love airplanes. I said, "I even wrote a blog about them! I should totally publish it so you can read it!" Well, here I am, sitting in an abandoned room in building 6C, attempting to procastinate on the mountain of work that waits for me by doing something that is like mildly, hypothetically productive: publishing said blog piece. I wrote this for my application to be an admissions blogger earlier this summer, so the timing is completely off but I hope you enjoy this little flashback of sorts.

**Yesterday**, with clothes and chargers and papers still strewn across my room, I wrestled the lid of my suitcase shut. Alexa continued marching through my carefully crafted packing playlist‚Ä¶

**Yesterday**, for the first time in 5 years, I stepped into Terminal D of the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.

If Evan Hansen‚Äôs thing is trees, mine is flying. From the constantly-yelling TSA agents to bland airplane food[^2], even flying‚Äôs most mundane minutiae bring me immeasurable joy. I‚Äôve spent hours catapulting between Wikipedia articles on the [flying vehicles that grace our skies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byEHjIpVt2A) and YouTube flight reviews of $20,000-voyages I‚Äôll probably never take in my life. Every single journey I‚Äôve made on a plane are among my most cherished experiences, but among all of these‚Äîno matter what‚Äîmy favorite is going back with my family to visit India[^3]. 

Terminal D is the hub of this all: DFW‚Äôs international terminal, where my excitement bubbles over as the trek begins. I can picture each inch of this space in crystal clarity[^4], and most of it looked the same when I returned. In fact, our gate was the same one it had been for the three previous trips that I could remember. My favorite hallmark of the atrium, however, the Einstein Bros Bagels, had shut down. My brother and I replaced the tradition with Auntie Anne‚Äôs pretzels instead. It was good, as Auntie Anne‚Äôs always is, but I longed for the comfortable nostalgia of hurriedly munching down on Einstein Bros‚Äô Everything Bagel with Butter.

  

**Yesterday**, I entered an Airbus A380[^5] for the first time ever. 

For the first leg of our trip, from Dallas-Fort Worth to London Heathrow, British Airways had brought back the superjumbo-jet to meet rapidly rising demand[^6]. I was literally tingling during boarding, and it. was. magnificent. The plane was even bigger than I could ever imagine, dwarfing the 777[^7] beside it at the gate. Nevertheless, with the help of four (!!!) boarding bridges spread across two gates, the plane was boarded in record time. Upon take off, I was taken by how _ginormous_ the wings and the extended wing flaps were. Despite the larger-than-customary windows, my entire view was practically just the wing. 

As we started cruising, we returned to the traditions. First, a synchronized movie watch on the TVs. Our choice this time was the 1992 romance/drama _The Bodyguard_ featuring Whitney Houston who, in my brother‚Äôs words, ‚Äúhas some serious pipes.‚Äù My dad fell asleep in the last stretch of the movie‚Äîlike always. Right before he slept, however, we checked off the final one of our flight rituals: messed up vegetarian meal orders. I actually smiled as it happened. Even as so much is changing in my life[^8], I‚Äôve come to view this incompetency is a rare form of constancy in the world‚Äîa never-changing source of (dis)comfort. After dinner, everybody headed to sleep, and I realized just how quiet the A380‚Äôs cabin is: the usual drone of the engine was replaced by the loud snores of the person behind me. Unable to sleep, I walked around and marveled at the second floor of the plane and appreciated the extremely tall cabin. (A few[^9] hours later, aboard the Boeing 787 Dreamliner from London to Mumbai, when my head bumped the top of the cabin while standing up, my appreciation for the A380 only redoubled).

  

**Yesterday**, I stared out at the clouds, 39,000 feet in the air.

A few other passengers and I sat awake on the plane, but I didn‚Äôt want to start another movie. So, I sat alone with my thoughts. I thought of what I wanted to eat in India (Pav Bhaji, Bombay Sandwich, Rava Dosa, Rajma were the start of that list). I thought of what I‚Äôd write in my blogger application. I thought about my changing ‚Äúheight, address, time zone, friendships, relationship with my parents, career/life/academic interests, grandparents‚Äô health, bla bla.‚Äù And then I thought of my dad‚Äôs smile when we reached our gate in Dallas, as he joined me in gawking at its wings from the window, upper deck from the staircase, and so on. 

I remembered the story he told me, how, at 18, he wanted to be a fighter pilot for the Indian Air Force but they rejected him[^10]. (Now, at 18, I‚Äôve already made plans to learn while at MIT, attaining a bit of stalker status on the Flying Club‚Äôs Discord). I searched further in my memories: the first time I ever researched anything about a plane. We were flying to San Francisco to visit some family, and my dad had mentioned that he was glad we were not flying on an MD-80. I immediately asked him what that meant, and he launched into monologue about the outdated aircraft that American Airlines insisted on flying‚Äîthat same toothy smile on his face. I became eager to board that flight, and after coming back to Dallas, I looked up everything about the MD-80 I could find. 

I never stopped appreciating flying after that. Maybe I genuinely enjoyed the feeling of flying, or maybe I wanted to have something to share with my dad. I don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôve stuck with my nine-year-old mindset ever since. One of my friends told me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like a little kid, and it‚Äôs adorable,‚Äù in reference to a particularly rambling and excited story I‚Äôd posted on Instagram. It‚Äôs interesting to think of how my dad and I have both somehow clung to this childlike love even as life has forced us to drop so many others. 

I wonder how my dad still views planes with such fondness after they faded out of reach after the Air Force rejected him, they separated him from his family when he moved to America at 21, and transported him away from his new family each week as he commuted to his Job in the Bay Area. I wonder if my love for flying will persist like his. Will the 4-hour flight that separates me from him and my mom taint it? Will I become too jaded by the faults in the industry to have that unfiltered appreciation anymore? I wonder if, as everything changes[^11], this will too. 

I realize that we‚Äôre just a subset of my family traveling to India today. In fact, we haven‚Äôt gone all together in almost a decade. Something or the other always holds back at least one of us. I realize this is the first time I won‚Äôt see any of my first cousins on this trip, as they‚Äôve all moved out. I realize that maybe everything has changed[^12] already. 

Master Oogway once [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPDwzCevL7s) ‚ÄúToday is a gift. That is why it is called the present.‚Äù I think that maybe my present present is the opportunity to create my own future these next few weeks in India. I can‚Äôt cling on to the past forever, but I can make sure that what comes is just as good.

So.

  

**Yesterday**[^13], I landed at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai.

The loud snores were replaced by the incessant sounds of honking‚Äîthe bellowing souls of 1.4 billion people.

  

**Yesterday**, I sat on a plane, waving through a window. Not at the bag carrier on the ground below, but at the freshly-18, still-kid shimmering in the reflection. It‚Äôs something that will never happen exactly like this again. But that‚Äôs okay‚Äîmaybe even good.

[^3]: Fun fact: my first time was when I was just barely one year old. #ExPatLife
[^4]: My memory is particularly garbage, so this is especially special for me.
[^5]: The A380 is the largest passenger aircraft ever built. It has two full levels and four engines and countless other technological innovations. It is very cool.
[^6]: Even then, it was probably only 70% occupied, illustrating why the A380 was retired even quicker than it was introduced.

[^13]: Yes, another fantastic song; this time Elton John.
