MIT is a lot.

I knew that coming in -- it's a huge part of why I chose this school. I knew I wanted my college experience to be intellectually challenging and allow me to explore hard questions. (Of course, at least as much of my decision was also due to the incredible community I found while visiting.) I spent hours scrolling through the MIT course catalog when I first got in, adding courses I hoped to take during my time here to a spreadsheet that quickly grew to hundreds of entries. I craved to spend my entire life studying at MIT. 

In the months that followed, however, I heard countless cautionary tales of MIT’s rigor in the ‘26 Discord, MIT Confessions, Admissions Blogs, and more. I took most of their advice -- carefully considering which classes were actually worth it for me to skip vs. take and easing into my first semester here. Armed with those choices, PNR [^1], and a lot of privilege to be well-prepared for my courses, classes this semester haven’t been too bad. Obviously, I’ve been intensely psetting like everyone else, but I’ve still been able to have fun experiences every day, build relationships, eat balanced meals, and call my parents. (Most of the time.)

So this post isn’t about pset hell, although I’m sure that time will come soon. Rather, I’ve been most scared about overextending myself outside of classes.

3rd days before classes started, I joined the Burton Third Bombers -- the most orange, rowdy, and culty living community on MIT’s campus [^2]. Our close-knit nature has made life at MIT more amazing than I could have ever imagined, but it also necessitates time and emotional commitments to nurture. 

On top of classes and my relationships, I’ve continued to stack on clubs and commitments that interest me. One of the special things about an institution like MIT is the plethora of opportunities pelted at you from all angles. I’ve applied to programs in socially conscious computing, research positions, clubs ranging from business to AI to student government -- and many of them have graciously come back with responses accepting me to their ranks. (Equally as many have said the opposite, of course.) As these obligations stack up, I can see my spare time each week slowly waning to zero. Will I have time to do my laundry? To cook like I planned to? To visit my friend at Wellesley or see musicals in New York?

Perversely, I find myself still wishing to do just that. PNR makes this semester the perfect to try piling food higher and higher onto my plate, because even if I trip and come crashing down, the maximum downside is some dirty laundry, less cooking, and more time in scenic Cambridge, MA.

But fate is cruel [^3]. Some of my commitments already have timing conflicts with others. And, as it turns out, they’re pitting different parts of myself against me. In my application to MIT, I wrote that “I wish to hone my skills and translate my affinity for math and computer science into addressing both personal and universal issues such as racial equity, LGBTQ+ liberation, and urban justice.” Yet, just third weeks into classes, unfortunate timing issues have forced me to choose between more professionally oriented opportunities and those focused on social issues close to my heart. Should I should ensure [^4] my stability in the future or should I take a risk and do what excites me. I think of all the sacrifices others have made to get me here today. Am I allowed to stand on all their backs only to choose something entirely for myself? Or do I owe it to those who brought me here to ensure I have a successful adult life after?

I suck at making decisions. I get attached to the possibilities of what can be, and fail to determine an unequivocal truth of which option is better. Here, I think, my love for the rationality of mathematics fails me. So, whenever a choice confronts me, even as simple as toppings at the Cava at Kendall, I tend to panic -- break from my processing algorithm and choose at random whichever option seems approximately righter at that moment in time.

I’ve faced a lot of similarly personality-wrenching decisions in the past. In 8th grade, I had to opt to stay enrolled in band and drop musical theatre because their performances were on the same weekend. Just the following year, I dropped band to attend a STEM magnet high school. I didn’t know what to do in either situation, and went with a crowdsourced decision from my friends. 

As it turns out, both of those less-than-ideal choices ended up okay. I’m sad about not being trained in musical theater, percussion, math, and policy, but I’m not sad about who I am right now. Maybe that means this choice will end up okay either way too. After all, I have 7 semesters (at least) remaining at MIT. But, also maybe I’m an adult now, who should hypothetically know what toppings he wants on his Cava bowl. And should be able to join college clubs without having a crisis and blogging on the internet. Adulthood is hard I think. And adulting at MIT is really hard. So, stay tuned and see, I guess, because God knows what I’ll decide. And maybe not even God knows how that will end up turning out.

[^2]: After being permanently assigned to Burton-Conner, my dorm, freshmen go through a floor exploration process called FLEX to find which floor's living community is the best fit for them. Living on Burton Third is also why I'll say third and 3rd instead of "three." Refer back to "culty."
