In the past week, more than one and less than three high school seniors have anxiously messaged me asking about what to do for their upcoming MIT Admissions interview. I only knew one of their names[^1] and the other was a nameless friend of a friend of a friend but I still desired to help them out as much as I could. Help, in this case, means one giant word: CHILL.

But you’d probably be more successful flying off the roof of the Green Building than telling a senior going through the college application process to chill, so I knew I needed to be slightly more verbose. However, I am also very lazy, and had the inkling that I would receive more such questions in the future. So, I decided to respond to these seniors with a “wait like two days i will post a blog abt this that will hopefully help lolz i hope its not too soon”

So, here goes.

* **I. Administrivia**.

Many Early Action applicants this year have already received requests from MIT alumni to participate in an interview for their application. As far as I know, these interviews are strongly recommended but not required. Moreover, do not panic if you haven’t received any invitation -- these are subject to availability of interviewers -- but it might be worth it to check your spam folder every now and then. (My Harvard interview took place a whole month after I received the email because it was sent to spam). Although my interview was on Zoom due to COVID, I believe in-person interviews are now available, depending on the interviewer.

* **II. Funistrivia**.

Genuinely, the MIT interview should be a positive opportunity for an applicant to ramble a bit about who they are and what they're interested in as well as learning a bit about how you might fit with MIT. Therefore, most interviewers do not expect you to wear a suit -- but it couldn’t hurt to look nice (especially if your pre-interview stalking reveals they are a bit older). Also, you don’t need to share a resume (especially if you don't have one) and some interviewers won't even accept them. Rather, your interviewer will go through a few questions to learn about you naturally -- some common ones include backstory about your life, your interests (academic _and_ non-academic), and fun, MIT-esque questions like “What animal best portrays your personality?”

These are opportunities for you to talk (hopefully briefly, to let the interviewer ask follow-ups or move on if needed) about things close to your heart. Relaxing and letting your passion flow is the best thing you can do to make this go smoothly. Your interviewer could have been your classmate if you were just a few years older, and they are truly interested in getting to know you as a person (and share some of that personality with the admissions committee). These two blog posts ([here](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/post_8/) and [here](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/notes-on-the-interview-the-ec-edition/)) by Chris S. ‘11 are great discussions of most of the interview process as both student and interviewer. 

I won’t repeat too many things from his posts, because I think you should read them yourself and also because I am indeed lazy and a wee bit hosed, but I would like to emphasize and add a few points. As Chris mentioned, you shouldn’t feel beholden to only talk about STEM during your interview. My interviewer asked me to teach him something, and I went on a 15-minute rant on criminal justice reform and prosecutorial discretion instead of any of the math stuff we had talked about previously. I also think it’s important to think deliberately (a little -- not too much or too stressfully) about how to highlight the parts of yourself that align with MIT’s spirit. Admissions talks about this beautifully in this [webpage](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/what-we-look-for/) and I particularly value making the world better, collaboration, creativity and inquiry, and character from it. Finally, be sure to keep the interview a two-way discussion and use it as an opportunity to learn more about MIT. Especially with more recent alumni, interviews offer many the first chance ever to talk to a real-life MIT student. It is a great opportunity to learn a little bit about some of the very exciting things on campus as well as perhaps wean out that MIT’s culture/offerings aren’t the best fit for you. (My Princeton interviewer shared a lot about the truly jaw dropping opportunities for social good in addition to some of the exclusivity he experienced on campus that helped me form a more accurate picture of the university).

* **III. Sadistrivia**.

All of this discussion holds true for the vast majority of MIT interviews, but there are bad apples in any batch. Some people’s interviews felt more cookie-cutter and didn’t offer them as much of an opportunity to shine, and that’s okay. This won’t hurt your application in any way. Chances are your interviewer simply had a long day -- as we all do -- and you will still be able to shine through your essays, letters of recommendation, and so much more. However, if you happen to have a genuinely harmful experience at your interview, please feel completely free to reach out to Admissions and let them know about your experience. From my experience with Admissions staff (which I think is exemplified in Paige and Jeremy’s blog post [here](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/06-coffee-in-the-pagi-nation/))[^2], they are some of the most amazing and kind people you will ever meet, and definitely want to ensure positive experiences for all applicants. (If you are worried about your application, draft an email with the relevant details but hit send after decisions are out). Again, I want to emphasize that this is a tiny tiny fraction of all MIT interviews, but something that I think is important to include especially for people of marginalized identities.
