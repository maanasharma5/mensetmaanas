In the past week, more than one and less than three high school seniors have anxiously messaged me asking about what to do for their upcoming MIT Admissions interview. I only knew one of their names and the other was a nameless friend of a friend of a friend but I still desired to help them out as much as I could. Help, in this case, means one giant word: CHILL.

But you’d probably be more successful flying off the roof of the Green Building than telling a senior going through the college application process to chill, so I knew I needed to be slightly more verbose. However, I am also very lazy, and had the inkling that I would receive more such questions in the future. So, I decided to respond to these seniors with a “wait like two days i will post a blog abt this that will hopefully help lolz i hope its not too soon.”

So, here goes.

* **I. Administrivia**.

Many Early Action applicants this year have already received requests from MIT alumni to participate in an interview for their application. As far as I know, these interviews are strongly recommended but not required. Moreover, do not panic if you haven’t received any invitation -- these are subject to availability of interviewers -- but it might be worth it to check your spam folder every now and then. (My Harvard interview took place a whole month after I received the email because it was sent to spam). Although my interview was on Zoom due to COVID, I believe in-person interviews are now available, depending on the interviewer. In-person interviews can be more nerve racking but I think that they can be valuable to form a more personal connection and prepare for future interviews as well. In-person interviews should be held in public, quiet places central to both you and your interviewer, but if travel is a burden to you, feel free to request a virtual conversation. If you do meet virtually, attempt to find a quiet, well-lit place with a good internet connection. Most interviews are scheduled for an hour, but some may last shorter or longer depending on how the conversation goes.

Genuinely, the MIT interview should be a positive opportunity for an applicant to ramble a bit about who they are and what they're interested in as well as learning a bit about how you might fit with MIT. Therefore, most interviewers do not expect you to wear a suit -- but it couldn’t hurt to look nice (especially if your pre-interview stalking reveals they are a bit older). Also, you don’t need to share a resume (especially if you don't have one) and some interviewers won't even accept them. Rather, your interviewer will go through a few questions to learn about you naturally -- some common ones include backstory about your life, your interests (academic _and_ non-academic), and fun, MIT-esque questions like “What animal best portrays your personality?” You can prepare (briefly) for these common questions (as Google searches will reveal), but relaxing and letting your passion flow is the best thing you can do to make this go smoothly. If you think about it, your interviewer could have been your classmate if you were just a few years older, and they are truly interested in getting to know you as a person (and share some of that personality with the admissions committee). 


Getting more into the details, these two blog posts ([here](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/post_8/) and [here](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/notes-on-the-interview-the-ec-edition/)) by Chris S. ‘11 are detailed discussions of the interview process I would consult. I won’t repeat too many things from his posts, because I think you should read them yourself and also because I am indeed lazy and a wee bit hosed, but I would like to add and emphasize few points. 

First, I recommend the Situation-Action-Learning framework as a way to confidently respond to the more formal questions. Before you answer, take a couple seconds to break your story into the set-up ("situation"), what you actually did ("action"), and what you learned from the experience ("learning"). This is a general communication strategy that will help the interviewer understand you easier and push the conversation forward. 

Additionally, as Chris mentioned, you shouldn’t feel beholden to only talk about STEM during your interview. My interview stumped me when he asked me to just “teach him something” and I opted to talk about criminal justice reform and prosecutorial discretion instead of any of the math stuff we had discussed previously. He also pushed back on my analysis, testing how I respond to conflict and explain my ideas. This may seem stressful, but it was easy because I was just myself. (Importantly, I’ve had many similar conversations here at MIT.) However, I also talked about the relationship to ethnic food, Taylor Swift, and favorite math theorem in the same one hour. This scope helps interviewers find nuances in how you align with MIT’s spirit. I’d even recommend reading this [beautiful Admissions page](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/what-we-look-for/) and introspect a little bit: what makes you a good fit? For example, if I were to do my interview again, I would think of how I could highlight how I particularly value making the world better, collaboration, and learning by doing in my responses, especially in the “situation” or “learning” sections.

Finally, be sure to keep the interview a two-way discussion and use it as an opportunity to learn more about MIT. For many, the interview can be your first chance to ever talk to a MIT student, so try and find out about some of the exciting things on campus or maybe even if MIT’s culture/offerings aren’t the best fit for you, especially if your interviewer is a recent alumni. I asked my interviewers what activities they were a part of during college, how their education specifically helped them in their careers, what they wished they’d known before college, one thing they would change about their experience, and even what they’d heard about the departments I was interested in. For my MIT interview, these questions didn’t reveal anything I hadn’t found in my college research, solely because my interviewer and I had quite different interests, but for other colleges, they helped me get nuanced takes on culture that I hadn’t been exposed to before.

* **III. Sadistrivia**.

All of this discussion holds true for the vast majority of MIT interviews, but there are bad apples in any batch. Some people’s interviews felt more cookie-cutter and didn’t offer them as much of an opportunity to shine, and that’s okay. This won’t hurt your application in any way. Chances are your interviewer simply had a long day -- as we all do -- and you will still be able to shine through your essays, letters of recommendation, and so much more. 

However, if you happen to have a genuinely harmful (e.g. demeaning, sexist, racist, etc) experience at your interview, please feel completely free to reach out to Admissions and let them know. From my experience with Admissions staff (which I think is exemplified in Paige and Jeremy’s blog post [here](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/06-coffee-in-the-pagi-nation/))[^1], they are some of the most amazing and kind people you will ever meet, and want to ensure positive experiences for all applicants. (If you are worried about your application, draft an email with the relevant details, but hit send after decisions are out). Again, I want to emphasize that this is a tiny tiny fraction of all MIT interviews, but is still important to mention, especially for people with marginalized identities.

**ANYWAY!** I hope this can maybe help you _chill with a plan_ if you have an upcoming interview. I have way too much actual stuff I have to do now that I’m done writing this…
