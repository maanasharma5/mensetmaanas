If you know me, you know I love musical theatre[^1]. Showtunes was my second most listened to genre last year and I will gladly spend all of my money on (and probably go into debt for) seeing musicals. I live for the experience of having a dozen of the best artists in the world on stage at once sharing their craft with me, aided by dozens of more artists behind the scenes. I especially love live theatre because of the way vocals soar in a theater and you can hear all the minute details of the orchestra roar in your ears in a way that recordings can never capture.

Well, one of the things I was most excited about when coming to MIT was the prospect of seeing more theatre. Boston has a vibrant theatre scene, fueled largely by college students, and a close proximity to New York, which, you know, has Broadway and many professional theatre companies. Indeed, in my first semester here, I’ve had the great opportunity to check out a couple musicals (and a few other honorable mentions), although I haven’t made time to go visit New York yet. (Hopefully during IAP … stay tuned). 

I’ll make my way through these, explaining a little bit of what the show is about, how I got tickets, and how I enjoyed it. I’ll stay away from full reviews because I am #notanexpert, but I will end with a (subjective) rating of my experience out of 5 stars and a short blurb summarizing my thoughts (without spoilers).

Without further adieu, 

**#1:** *Sing Street*, The Huntington Theatre Company

*Sing Street* is a musical based on the film of the same name that was helmed by a pretty star-studded creative team. It takes place in 1980s Ireland following a shy boy’s attempt to impress a girl by forming a band and exploring its impacts on the relationships and people surrounding him. It was set to begin performances on Broadway in 2020, but was shut down by COVID-19 before it ever did. So, in 2022, the show was revived for a second pre-Broadway production in Boston with a new cast and some minor changes.

I was really excited to see *Sing Street* because the creative team and reviews from its first production were really stellar. Upon further inspection, the Huntington offered some really gracious student ticket discounts, and my friend and I got front and center orchestra seats for like 10% of their true cost. It also happened to be opening night, which had amazing energy, and made for an overall great experience.

My rating: 3.5/5[^2]

**#2:** *In The Heights*, Harvard TEATRO!

*In The Heights* is Lin Manuel Miranda’s first musical that won four Tony awards when it premiered on Broadway in 2008. The show follows a tight-knit group of characters in the largely Hispanic, working-class neighborhood of Washington Heights in New York for the course of three (action-packed) days. 

*In The Heights* is possibly my favorite musical of all time -- its authentic treatment of underrepresented stories on Broadway (that are intensely relatable to people like me), groundbreaking music style, and character development are stellar -- but I’d never gotten the opportunity to see it live before. When I saw that Harvard was putting on a production of it, I knew that I had to get tickets. I went with my best friend with great center orchestra seats for a decent price. 

My rating: 4.5/5[^3]

**#3:** *Life of Pi*, American Repertory Theatre

*Life of Pi* made its North American debut at the American Repertory Theatre, a Cambridge-based nonprofit theater that has won a Pulitzer Prize and four Tony Awards. The play[^4] is a newly reimagined version of the classic novel that recently won five Olivier Awards on London’s West End. It was renowned for its innovative use of puppetry and effective portrayal of the fantastical story, and the A.R.T. production is a short tryout before a transfer to Broadway.

I had been tracking this show for months before coming to MIT, for many reasons. First, I’d really enjoyed the movie when it came out and I was intrigued to see how it might be translated to the stage. Also, I was really looking forward to seeing South Asian representation on Broadway. Finally, this would be my first play and I was looking to expand my #literaryconsumption after really enjoying AP Lit senior year. Plus, I had the unique opportunity to see the play before it went to Broadway, at which point it would likely become much more difficult and expensive to see. Thankfully, the A.R.T. also has generous student pricing, so I was able to get good orchestra seats to a preview performance.

My rating: 4.5/5[^5]

[^1]: I’m going to keep spelling theatre like theatre because my middle school drama teacher told me that theat*re* means the art and theat*er* means the physical building and I’d trust her with my life.
[^2]: This show was pretty enjoyable but it lacked the oomph factor I generally look for in theatre.
[^3]: As I said before, I think the show itself is pretty damn perfect. However, I deducted half a star due to the production casting several white actors in the show, which I and much of the theatre community believe to be antithetical to the message and intention of the show. Aside from that, most of the performances were steller, although the orchestra and choreography was just okay, and I still really enjoyed the show.
[^4]: Yes, this isn’t a musical but whatever still it’s close enough
[^5]: I *really* enjoyed this show. I was pleasantly surprised by how incredibly Lolita Chakrabarti and the creative team were able to show the mystical events on stage through the puppetry, lighting design, and set design. The cast were also incredible and seeing authentic South Asian characters was quite refreshing. I took slight issue with the pacing of the show, because the second half is quite dense philosophically, but I appreciated why Chakrabarti made the decisions she did.
