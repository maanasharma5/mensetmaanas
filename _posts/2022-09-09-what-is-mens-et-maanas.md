There's so much I want to talk about in this post -- my first post! But, I will try to stay as close to answering the title question as possible.

What. is. mens. et. maanas. ?.

If you live within a one or two square mile radius of me right now, chances are this phrase sounds a bit familiar. *mens et manus* is the motto of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It means "mind and hand," a reflection of MIT's belief in education for practical value and tangible good. It's not as popular on campus as say Harvard's *veritas*, but it's just well-known enough on campus to carry me through my first weeks on campus. [FPOP](https://firstyear.mit.edu/orientation/pre-orientation-programs-fpops/), Orientation, [REX](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/rexachusetts-institute-of-technology/), [FLEX](https://bc.mit.edu/flex), etc. were full of canned introductions repeated hundreds of times over. Like clockwork, each time I'd say my name, the other person would lean in closer to me and politely ask me to repeat it. "Maanas," I'd repeat. 

I've had my name for 18 years now, but I never devised a clever way to help people understand how to pronounce it. I've told people "Say 'man' with a Jamaican accent, then kiss without the k" a nonzero amount of times, but that's a bit unwieldy. So, I still rely on a parroting routine until the other person gets close enough -- or just give up and tell them to call me one of my many nicknames. Halfway into REX, during one of these parroting practices, the other person (I can't quite remember who) lit up with a smile and said -- "OMG? Like *mens et manus*?" -- and I shrieked "Yes!" My name was pronounced the exact same (ish) as the second half of our school's motto! Finally, I'd found an easy way to get people to pronounce my name properly, quickly. I was excited to be spared of a good deal of social awkwardness for the rest of the week, and for the most part it worked. (Some people still just stared at me blankly, having no idea what _mens et manus_ was. Valid, I guess.)

I grew to quite like this pun-of-sorts. It connected me to my school and community, was practical, and slightly funny. Plus, _manasa_ in Sanskrit means "mind" so I'm basically saying "mind and mind" -- a half inside joke I enjoy as well.

But, in the context of this website -- the unwieldy maanasharma5.github.io/blog [^1] -- "mens et maanas" is what I chose to type into the title box in Github fifteen minutes ago. 

It's a clean summary of what I plan to do here. I was recently rejected from the MIT Admissions Blogging team, which was saddening, but I stand by my desire to blog. Writing helps me process my emotions, and I enjoy sharing things with the world! Petey told me it's important to try and keep writing at MIT because MIT life is hard, so I'm here trying. Writing by myself is more difficult -- I have to learn how Github works, and Markdown, and there's no money that comes with, but as a wise upperclassmen told me, "[PNR](https://mitadmissions.org/help/faq/pass-no-record/) is a lifestyle" and I intend to make the most of it this year, pushing myself to do difficult (but important and maybe fun) things. Plus, I'd be lying if I said I didn't hope this might help me get accepted as an Admissions Blogger at some point. I came into MIT with only 3rd concrete goals: become a Blogger, learn how to fly, and hypothetically get a degree.

So, _mens et maanas_ will be my space to talk about MIT and me, other people and me, just me, just MIT, stuff probably only I care about, and anything else I can somehow tie to this name. It's a place to grow my mind and hand (and the recently added heart). I hope you enjoy the journey. Please bear with me as I try and set up the site to be a little bit more welcoming and have more features as well.

Love always,
MKS
