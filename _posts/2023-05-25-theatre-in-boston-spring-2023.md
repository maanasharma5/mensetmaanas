welcome to the third installment of THEATRE IN BOSTON, the blog series where i write about my favorite hobby, watching -- not making because i am unskilled -- theatre. this semester, i watched 6 shows -- four musicals and two plays, from amateur school productions to broadway and everything in between -- and i'm excited to share little tidbits about each of them right now[^1].

well, let's get started!

**#1:** *Heathers: The Musical*, MIT Musical Theatre Guild

*Heathers* is a musical adaptation of the older teen dark comedy movie of the same name. It's well known in the (teenage) musical theatre community for having an absolute banger of a cast recording but never making it to Broadway[^2]. Although I had a pretty good idea of all the plot points of the show from the cast recording and just *life* I was still really excited to see it in person for the first time. I was also looking forward to my first MTG show. I respect the hell out of the cast, crew, and orchestra for putting so much time into the show even when MIT gets so busy.

My rating: 4/5[^3]

**#2:** *Wicked*, Gershwin Theatre (Broadway)

I think everybody (or, rather, many many people) know about *Wicked*. It is the second-highest grossing musical in Broadway history, launched Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth to fame, and has been a staple of the Broadway experience for tourists for decades. Given that, however, I'd actually never paid too much attention to the show. Of course, I'd heard (and loved) the standout musical numbers of the show, but the plot didn't interest me as much. Also given how expensive tickets usually are, the fact that it will likely run for at least another decade, and that my consumption of Broadway shows is quite limited, I'd never sought to see it.

However, this all changed in February -- *DUM DUM DUM* -- on the anniversary of my birth 19 years prior[^4]. 

LOL anyway my dad and I decided to meet in New York for my birthday, but his flight got delayed so I had a magically free Friday night to spend. Obviously, I decided to see a musical (because my dad is not generally a fan of the ðŸŒ artsðŸŒ , I was trying to minimize his pain on the things I forced him to do). I hopped on TodayTix and the *Wicked* tickets were actually quite reasonably priced so I impulse bought them! 

It was a great decision. The costume and set design was amazing and the performances are just thrilling. There are definitely some issues with the book -- it's definitely idealistic and it lacks true characterization at times -- but those are kind of irrelevant. *Wicked* just takes you away from reality for a few hours and it's a joy to watch. It certainly deserves its place in Broadway history and I will surely be back to watch it again.

My rating: 4.5/5[^5]

**#3:** *The Jungle*, St. Ann's Warehouse (Off-Broadway)

*The Jungle* is the most unique and impactful show I have ever had the privilege of seeing. I was in tears during the show, in bed after, and have even spontaneously teared up thinking about it months later. At the risk of sounding pretentious, I continue to think of it not as a show, but as an experience.

*The Jungle* is an immersive play based off a real-life migrant and refugee settlement outside of Calais, France. The camp was a self-sufficient informal community of thousands of migrants hoping to enter the United Kingdom or waiting for French asylum, with residents of numerous nationalities, ethnicities, and religions. Living conditions were indeed poor in "The Jungle," but residents and local volunteers built restaurants, theatres, and more in the camp and had largely found ways to bridge historical divides between individual communities. Residents of the camp were supported by some NGO efforts, but the French people and government were vehemently opposed to the camp. In 2016, the camp was entirely cleared out by the French government. 

*The Jungle* is written by two white Englishmen who volunteered at the camp to create a theater there. The play honors the stories they witnessed. It recreates the tent theatre and a community restaurant inside the Brooklyn warehouse-converted-to-theater, with dirt floors and freshly-made naan and chai served by the cast itself. The show is performed largely by a cast of refugees and immigrants, some from The Jungle itself, but also includes portrayals (and interrogations) of the largely white volunteers at the camp. The story of The Jungle is complicated, but the show aptly realizes that it is not it's place to resolve the mess for us. It brings authenticity at a level I have never seen before, and I am immensely grateful for that.

My rating: 5/5[^6]

**#4:** *MJ: The Musical*, Neil Simon Theatre (Broadway)

[^1]: As a reminder, I try not to comment too much on my opinions on the show in the main body of the text, as they are honestly irrelevant and I donâ€™t want to take away from the work and skill of anybody involved with the show. However, I will end with my personal rating out of 5 and a footnote expanding on some of my thoughts.
[^2]: because it kinda like only appeals to teenagers, so it's not quite commercially viable in a ginormous Broadway theater.
[^3]: As part of *Heathers*' target audience, I really relished the show, although I can completely understand why others might not. Again, huge kudos to the MTG team, but there were definitely cracks in the show simply because theatre is none of our primary pursuits. I don't think it takes away from the show too much, but just internally having the cast recording in the back of my mind all the time meant that some of those differences stuck out a bunch to me personally.
[^4]: (approximately)
[^5]: Nothing much to add here, lol, I wrote a lot in the main body of the blog.
[^6]: I have sat down to write a full "review" about *The Jungle* so many times but I always end up overwhelmed with the task. Truly, I feel like words fail to describe the show and its strengths and weaknesses.
