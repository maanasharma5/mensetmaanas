welcome to the third installment of THEATRE IN BOSTON, the blog series where i write about my favorite hobby, watching -- not making because i am unskilled -- theatre. this semester, i watched 6 shows -- four musicals and two plays, from amateur school productions to broadway and everything in between -- and i'm excited to share little tidbits about each of them right now[^1].

well, let's get started!

**#1:** *Heathers: The Musical*, MIT Musical Theatre Guild

*Heathers* is a musical adaptation of the older teen dark comedy movie of the same name. It's well known in the (teenage) musical theatre community for having an absolute banger of a cast recording but never making it to Broadway[^1]. Although I had a pretty good idea of all the plot points of the show from the cast recording and just *life* I was still really excited to see it in person for the first time. I was also looking forward to my first MTG show. I respect the hell out of the cast, crew, and orchestra for putting so much time into the show even when MIT gets so busy.

My rating: 4/5[^2]

**#2:** *Wicked*, Gershwin Theatre (Broadway)

I think everybody (or, rather, many many people) know about *Wicked*. It is the second-highest grossing musical in Broadway history, launched Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth to fame, and has been a staple of the Broadway experience for tourists for decades. Given that, however, I'd actually never paid too much attention to the show. Of course, I'd heard (and loved) the standout musical numbers of the show, but the plot didn't interest me as much. Also given how expensive tickets usually are, the fact that it will likely run for at least another decade, and that my consumption of Broadway shows is quite limited, I'd never sought to see it.

However, this all changed in February. 

*DUM DUM DUM*.




My rating: 4.5/5[^5]

**#3:** *Kimberly Akimbo*, Booth Theatre (Broadway)

*Kimberly Akimbo* blends the two extremes of the human experience, following the story of a teenage girl who suffers from a disease that ages her at 4.5 times the normal rate as she seeks to find happiness in the face of her disease, family problems, and loneliness. The show is new on Broadway this season, after an award-winning off-Broadway run, and I wanted to see it before the Tony Awards (when it will likely get a boost in popularity). The cast recording hasn’t even been released for the show, so I had little idea what I was getting into, but tickets were not too expensive and I’d been wanting to visit New York during IAP for a long time so I finally went in the last week of January. It was well worth it.

My rating: 4/5[^6]

[^1]: As a reminder, I try not to comment too much on my opinions on the show in the main body of the text, as they are honestly irrelevant and I don’t want to take away from the work and skill of anybody involved with the show. However, I will end with my personal rating out of 5 and a footnote expanding on some of my thoughts.
[^2]: because it kinda like only appeals to teenagers, so it's not quite commercially viable in a ginormous Broadway theater.
[^3]: As part of *Heathers*' target audience, I really relished the show, although I can completely understand why others might not. Again, huge kudos to the MTG team, but there were definitely cracks in the show simply because theatre is none of our primary pursuits. I don't think it takes away from the show too much, but just internally having the cast recording in the back of my mind all the time meant that some of those differences stuck out a bunch to me personally.
[^4]: There were student rush tickets available for a reasonable price, but I didn’t want to take the risk of traveling to an entirely different state and having the tickets run out.
[^5]: I think *Jagged Little Pill* accomplishes what it tries to do in the best possible way, but what it tries to do is necessarily riddled with danger zones in and of itself. Weaving an album like *Jagged Little Pill* into a show is no easy task. So, although I generally enjoyed the show a *lot*, especially individual performances, there were also plenty of moments where I felt like things were just awkward or cringy or unneeded.
[^6]: I honestly have no particularly negative thoughts about *Kimberly Akimbo* -- its performances were great, the music is enjoyable, and I think the show is well-written for what it tries to be. However, I think I look for something more emotionally raw in a show, and *Kimberly Akimbo* definitely tries to be joyous and approachable, which is the only reason I gave it such a comparably low score.
