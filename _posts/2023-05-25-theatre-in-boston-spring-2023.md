welcome to the third installment of THEATRE IN BOSTON, the blog series where i write about my favorite hobby, watching -- not making because i am unskilled -- theatre. this semester, i watched 6 shows -- four musicals and two plays, from amateur school productions to broadway and everything in between -- and i'm excited to share little tidbits about each of them right now[^1].

well, let's get started!

**#1:** *Heathers: The Musical*, MIT Musical Theatre Guild

*Heathers* is a musical adaptation of the older teen dark comedy movie of the same name. It's well known in the (teenage) musical theatre community for having an absolute banger of a cast recording but never making it to Broadway[^2]. Although I had a pretty good idea of all the plot points of the show from the cast recording and just *life* I was still really excited to see it in person for the first time. I was also looking forward to my first MTG show. I respect the hell out of the cast, crew, and orchestra for putting so much time into the show even when MIT gets so busy.

My rating: 4/5[^3]

**#2:** *Wicked*, Gershwin Theatre (Broadway)

I think everybody (or, rather, many many people) know about *Wicked*. It is the second-highest grossing musical in Broadway history, launched Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth to fame, and has been a staple of the Broadway experience for tourists for decades. Given that, however, I'd actually never paid too much attention to the show. Of course, I'd heard (and loved) the standout musical numbers of the show, but the plot didn't interest me as much. Also given how expensive tickets usually are, the fact that it will likely run for at least another decade, and that my consumption of Broadway shows is quite limited, I'd never sought to see it.

However, this all changed in February -- *DUM DUM DUM* -- on the anniversary of my birth 19 years prior[^4]. 

LOL anyway my dad and I decided to meet in New York for my birthday, but his flight got delayed so I had a magically free Friday night to spend. Obviously, I decided to see a musical (because my dad is not generally a fan of the ðŸŒ artsðŸŒ , I was trying to minimize his pain on the things I forced him to do). I hopped on TodayTix and the *Wicked* tickets were actually quite reasonably priced so I impulse bought them! It was a great decision. 

My rating: 4.5/5[^5]

**#3:** *The Jungle*, St. Ann's Warehouse (Off-Broadway)

*The Jungle* is the most unique and impactful show I have ever had the privilege of seeing. I was in tears during the show, in bed after, and have even spontaneously teared up thinking about it months later. At the risk of sounding pretentious, I continue to think of it not as a show, but as an experience.

*The Jungle* is an immersive play based off a real-life migrant and refugee settlement outside of Calais, France. The camp was a self-sufficient informal community of thousands of migrants hoping to enter the United Kingdom or waiting for French asylum, with residents of numerous nationalities, ethnicities, and religions. Living conditions were indeed poor in "The Jungle," but residents and local volunteers built restaurants, theatres, and more in the camp and had largely found ways to bridge historical divides between individual communities. Residents of the camp were supported by some NGO efforts, but the French people and government were vehemently opposed to the camp. In 2016, the camp was entirely cleared out by the French government. 

*The Jungle* is written by two white Englishmen who volunteered at the camp to create a theater there. The play honors the stories they witnessed. It recreates the tent theatre and a community restaurant inside the Brooklyn warehouse-converted-to-theater, with dirt floors and freshly-made naan and chai served by the cast itself. The show is performed largely by a cast of refugees and immigrants, some from The Jungle itself, but also includes portrayals (and interrogations) of the largely white volunteers at the camp. The story of The Jungle is complicated, but the show aptly realizes that it is not its place to resolve the mess for us. It brings authenticity at a level I have never seen before in the theater, and I am immensely grateful for that.

My rating: 5/5[^6]

**#4:** *MJ: The Musical*, Neil Simon Theatre (Broadway)
*MJ* is a jukebox biographical musical on the work and life of Michael Jackson -- and was a great compromise activity for my dad and I on our trip. My dad loved Michael Jackson's music growing up, so I figured he would actually stay awake through this musical[^7], and tickets to the show were way too expensive for me to ever buy on my own. The musical's performance at the Tony's had gotten me interested in the show so I was delighted to see the show. 

My rating: 4.5/5[^8]

**#5:** *Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes: Part One: Millenium Approaches*, Central Square Theater

*Angels in America* is one of those foundational works of modern, especially modern political and modern queer, theatre. It is also, because I have no formal education in theatre and only became interested in it halfway through highschool, one that I had never heard about. However, when one of my classmates mentioned watching it just up Mass. Ave. at the Central Square Theatre (with a great student discount) I bought tickets immediately. Only after buying tickets did I learn how important the work was in gay representation in drama, and, although I am glad I now know about the show, I am not necessarily its biggest fan. (Side note: this is why I so desperately want to take a class on modern political/{racial, ethnic, queer, gendered} theatre)

My rating: 3.5/5[^9] (oop)

**#6:** *Evita*, American Repertory Theater

*Evita* is the popular Andrew Lloyd Webber musical based on the First Lady of Argentina Eva Peron and her life. I'd heard rumblings about the revival of *Evita* at the ART on TikTok for months, and people were quite excited for it. As with many ART revivals, the show was expected to go to Broadway, so I wanted to take advantage of ART's great student pricing to check it out here in Cambridge! This production was put on with lots of background research on Eva Peron's life and legacy in Argentina and more integration of the Argentinian culture, including professional tango dancers and an all-Latine cast. Ultimately, though, I was not a huge fan.

My rating: 3/5[^10]


[^1]: As a reminder, I try not to comment too much on my opinions on the show in the main body of the text, as they are honestly irrelevant and I donâ€™t want to take away from the work and skill of anybody involved with the show. However, I will end with my personal rating out of 5 and a footnote expanding on some of my thoughts.
[^2]: because it kinda like only appeals to teenagers, so it's not quite commercially viable in a ginormous Broadway theater.
[^3]: As part of *Heathers*' target audience, I really relished the show, although I can completely understand why others might not. Again, huge kudos to the MTG team, but there were definitely cracks in the show simply because theatre is none of our primary pursuits. I don't think it takes away from the show too much, but just internally having the cast recording in the back of my mind all the time meant that some of those differences stuck out a bunch to me personally.
[^4]: (approximately)
[^5]: The performances were as thrilling as expected; I was on the edge of my seat in awe of the show so many times. The costume and set design was also particularly standout, which I didn't think much about before. There are definitely some issues with the book -- it's surely idealistic and it lacks in characterization at times -- but those are kind of irrelevant: *Wicked* just takes you away from reality for a few hours and it's a joy to watch. It certainly deserves its place in Broadway history and I will be back to watch it again as so many have before me.
[^6]: I can't add much here: I have sat down to write a full "review" about *The Jungle* so many times but I always end up overwhelmed with the task. Truly, I feel like words fail to completely describe the show and my thoughts on its complexity. It is exceptional to watch unfold in front of you, but I strongly recommend that everybody read the play since it's unlikely to be able to see the production.
[^7]: unlike *Company* which is actually crazy... how can you sleep through Patti Lupone's "Ladies Who Lunch"
[^8]: The energy in *MJ* was incredible. Like most jukebox musicals, it was super fun and didn't try to be some insightful commentary on the world. The songs were incorporated reasonably well into the book through the plot device of rehearsals for his tour, and everybody in the room was bouncing with anticipation for the next song and smiling broadly whenever one was played. The dancing was, as expected, also phenomenal. It was also refreshing to see a Broadway audience not filled with the, let's just say, traditional, Broadway audience. That being said, the show does does completely ignore Michael Jackson's controversies and paints him in a uniformly positive light, which is certainly something to consider. 
[^9]: This rating is certainly not one you'd expect for a Pulitzer prize-winning and multiple Tony Best Play/Revival-winning work, so let me explain. First of all, let me say it is not because of any issues with the production or cast -- they were exceptional. Also, I fully understand the importance and skill of the techniques Tony Kushner uses in the play: I appreciate the play in an academic way. However, when I think of how much I actually enjoyed the show, I think the play failed to come together as one for me and I didn't connect with it as much as I expected it to. I have thought of three possible reasons for this. One, the show was three and a half hours long. I get *why* it's so long, but no matter how important the material or strong the performances, it's really hard for the audience to enjoy the show the entire time. (Especially with the complexity of the storytelling in *Angels in America*). Second, the show is only one half of the complete work: much of the plot in this half sets up further exploration in Part Two. As a result, to me, this show felt unfinished (despite being three and a half hours long), because, well, it is. Third, the show feels very removed from my experiences. I'm not talking about the symbolic angels and devils in the show, but rather the reality it depicts. The power-hungry Roy Cohn and the associated government plot lines, although real, are peculiarly specific to the McCarthy period and those familiar with twentieth century New York politics and power. Even Joe's wife, the agoraphobic valium addict, reminds me more of the caricatured Sheila on *Shameless* than a tangible and touching conflict. After watching the first part (the second will show at Central Square Theater next season), I question how truly timeless *Angels in America* is. In a world post-COVID and that recognizes that crises affects intersectional marginalizations the most, I want more. However, I have not seen the second part of the play, and I am actually quite excited for it (the ending was a big cliffhanger). Maybe my opinion will change. 
[^10]: First, the good: the set design was really cool and the performances, especially Shereen Pimental as Evita and the dancers were stellar. However, I just didn't quite like the show. (Another hot take, I know). I felt that the music (billed to be a "rock opera") didn't actually integrate the two styles, and songs simply alternated between the two genres. The show is noted for show-stopping operatic numbers from Evita, but these songs feel one-off and isolated, not connected to each other musically. I also just don't think that the content of the show has aged well. The book was crafted on a mysognistic characterization of Evita as sleeping her way to the top, stealing power, and maintaining a two-faced facade; no amount of reworking can shed that basis of the material. Finally, although the updated choreography was beautiful, it stuck out in the show: in many places, the dancing did not help advance the plot at all, it was simply there to look pretty in the background. One final side note: I did watch *Evita* right in the middle of finals week, so it is possible my stress (and sleepiness during the show) are confounding variables in my reaction to the show. Ultimately, I am unconvinced that we needed this revival. The cast, and the community, deserve more original and authentic Latine stories in theatre -- not this.
