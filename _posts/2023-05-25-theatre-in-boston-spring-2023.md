i LOVE IAP!!! If you didn't know, IAP stands for the Independent Activities Period -- a term in January where MIT students do not have to take any classes and can choose their own adventure. There are countless options of things to do: many departments offer short classes for credit or not for credit, people often research or have micro-internships, and going abroad with MISTI is also popular. Still others forgo all the complexity to stay home and relax. Although there is decent pressure to "make the most" of IAP here, I decided to relax during IAP but still stay on campus. As a freshman, there are like a million things I've wanted to try but felt like I didn't have the time to do, and my goal was to start tackling those tasks during IAP. 

Of course, I didn’t accomplish many of the productive things I set out to do (e.g. I still don’t particularly know how to cook) but I did indeed accomplish the non-productive ones! In particular, I love exploring cities, visiting art museums, coffee shops, and book stores, and watching theatre. Indeed, for the last two weeks of IAP[^1], I think I did at least one of those things a day. Hell yeah. I’m probably not going to write about all the places I visited (because there are a lot and I am lazy) but I will continue my tradition of writing about the theatre[^2] I see every term, which should provide a glimpse into some of the places I visited!

Without further adieu,

**#1:** *Preludes*, Lyric Stage Company of Boston

*Preludes* is a musical brainchild of Dave Malloy, Tony-nominated playwright and composer known for his experimental methods and inspiration from historical sources. It follows Russian composer Rachmaninoff as he struggles to get over his writer’s block after an ill-received first symphony. It is not a super famous musical by any means, but was very well-received in its first off-Broadway run, and I am a *ginormous* fan of Rachmaninoff (and especially his set of piano preludes, which gave the show its name) so I really wanted to see the show. With the Lyric Stage Company’s generous student discounts, there were plenty of affordable options to see the show.

My rating: 3/5[^3]

**#2:** *Jagged Little Pill*, Touring at the Providence Performing Arts Center

*Jagged Little Pill* is a musical that follows a suburban Connecticut family as they struggle through a number of issues including opioid addiction, gender and sexuality, sexual assault, and racism, with its music coming from Alanis Morissette’s groundbreaking rock album of the same name. And, as you may have already noticed, this show was not in Boston at all. *Jagged Little Pill* is one of those musicals that I have wanted to see for a long time; I really enjoy its cast album but it’s clear that seeing it live would inspire a completely different experience. As such, when I heard its tour was coming to Providence, I immediately planned a short day trip on the commuter rail and bought tickets. Unfortunately, there are usually few discount options for touring productions, and I had to pay full price for a second mezzanine ticket[^4]. Nonetheless, the seat was good, with great sight lines and sound in one of the most beautiful stunning theaters I’ve ever seen.

My rating: 4.5/5[^5]

**#3:** *Kimberly Akimbo*, Booth Theatre (Broadway)

*Kimberly Akimbo* blends the two extremes of the human experience, following the story of a teenage girl who suffers from a disease that ages her at 4.5 times the normal rate as she seeks to find happiness in the face of her disease, family problems, and loneliness. The show is new on Broadway this season, after an award-winning off-Broadway run, and I wanted to see it before the Tony Awards (when it will likely get a boost in popularity). The cast recording hasn’t even been released for the show, so I had little idea what I was getting into, but tickets were not too expensive and I’d been wanting to visit New York during IAP for a long time so I finally went in the last week of January. It was well worth it.

My rating: 4/5[^6]

[^1]: (after I’d recovered from jet lag upon returning from India)
[^2]: As a reminder, I try not to comment too much on my opinions on the show in the main body of the text, as they are honestly irrelevant and I don’t want to take away from the work and skill of anybody involved with the show. However, I will end with my personal rating out of 5 and a footnote expanding on some of my thoughts.
[^3]: I think a lot of the show was really well-done -- orchestrations, set design, and the core conceptualization of Rachmaninoff -- but I felt like it overall failed to emotionally connect with me. In particular, a lot of the characters were undeveloped and used as vehicles to push a certain plot point and I wish that the show reached more of a climax that reflected its messages about Rachmaninoff’s vigor and energy.
[^4]: There were student rush tickets available for a reasonable price, but I didn’t want to take the risk of traveling to an entirely different state and having the tickets run out.
[^5]: I think *Jagged Little Pill* accomplishes what it tries to do in the best possible way, but what it tries to do is necessarily riddled with danger zones in and of itself. Weaving an album like *Jagged Little Pill* into a show is no easy task. So, although I generally enjoyed the show a *lot*, especially individual performances, there were also plenty of moments where I felt like things were just awkward or cringy or unneeded.
[^6]: I honestly have no particularly negative thoughts about *Kimberly Akimbo* -- its performances were great, the music is enjoyable, and I think the show is well-written for what it tries to be. However, I think I look for something more emotionally raw in a show, and *Kimberly Akimbo* definitely tries to be joyous and approachable, which is the only reason I gave it such a comparably low score.
