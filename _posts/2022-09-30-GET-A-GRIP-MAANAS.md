So this is a, um, very quick update to my last blog post.

Turns out, things ended up resolving themselves very nicely, very quickly. I was granted my wish of turning up the pressure on the firehose -- which probably means y'all are going to be treated to many more instances of "overworked, slightly crazy maanas blogging when he should instead be fixing his life." Hope you like it!

Real talk, though, I'm super grateful for all the opportunities MIT offers. I'm getting to explore business, airplane construction, and social and ethical responsibilities in computing -- third things I never thought I'd be able to do right in first semester. There's definitely a (large) chance that these responsibilities stack up and may get a bit overwhelming at times, but PNR is there to help with that. I'm still excited till that point comes, though, and even if/when it does, it'll teach me important lessons about what I can and can't handle.

Anyway, that's it for me, I just wanted to come in an offer an update on my emotional dump from just a few days ago because the immediate resolution was quite quite funny. I now know I should give things a little bit more time to simmer and settle down before writing about them publicly on the internet. LOL.
