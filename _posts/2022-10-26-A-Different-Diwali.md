Yesterday (Monday) marked Diwali[^1] -- a Hindu religious festival celebrating the triumph of good over evil and light over darkness. For the first time, it was lonely. It lacked color. Hell, it even lacked light. 

If the melodramatics weren’t clear, this was my first Diwali away from my family. Generally, I’m a pretty independent person; I love my family and I wish they were closer, but I also appreciate some of the things I’m able to do “alone” at college. But Diwali set all my rational parts ablaze. All I could feel was the pain of being away from my closest loved ones on a day that we’d celebrated in full force together for 17 years. I longed to embrace my mom in a hug that she holds for longer than I do. To hear my dad’s corny life lessons in person. To sit next to my grandma and feel her jump up slightly upon my impact on the couch. To hold my dog at eye level during the aarti to get him to stop barking.

Instead, I got a Zoom call: 720p quality connecting me to where I longed to be, 1785 miles away. My brother and I followed along as my parents performed the prayer ceremony. Well, as much as we could without the proper prayer materials or even new clothes to wear for the festival. The newly-painted Institute White walls of my room stared at me instead of the gilded brass diyas, colorful flowers and fabrics, and vibrant Rangoli designs of my memories. 

Memories. They came back to me in waves. Summers in Baroda, when I called my grandma, who’s voice cracked when she picked up the phone. Afternoons spent talking with my mom as we did household tasks together, as her voice cracked singing the first words of the prayers. (I also realized I hadn’t done this in years.) My grandpa, dad, and brother, crazily running to set the biggest fireworks in our box as I stayed far away in the garage, half scared and half in awe.

My first “adult” Diwali was the most dull yet. I don’t think I can celebrate it in my institute triple exactly like we did back home, especially without my family and the stress of firehose, but I have to start trying. Even though I am in the process of lighting new candles in my life, I have to take care to not let my preexisting flames flicker out -- ones that have been carefully tended for centuries.
