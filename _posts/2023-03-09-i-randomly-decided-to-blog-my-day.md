**it’s 11:41 pm right now** and i’m sitting in the BC TV Lounge writing this blog post. a couple of minutes ago, i was laying down, thinking of the work i have left for the day and i had the jarring realization that i hadn’t blogged in a long while. yesterday i was talking to a friend about just how quickly 3 weeks of non-PNR life at MIT has aged me. from planning cpw for the soon-to-be frosh at my dorm to finally having to worry about grades, i truly feel more like a sophomore right now than i do a freshman. in particular, the never-ending firehose of work has kept me from blogging because any time i have free time nowadays, i choose to spend it hanging out with friends or watching tv in my bed -- two of my biggest comfort activities -- and blogging is relegated onto the long list of things i want to do when (if) i find time and the willpower. but it’s been a month and i haven’t found any willpower. i also know that i really really want to be an admissions blogger, and showing that i can keep a routine is a big part of that. so, at 11:21 tonight, i decided that i should post something. it might not be the most beautiful thing i’ve ever written, or even maybe good at all, but i told myself i would write something. the first thing that came to my mind was a step-by-step walkthrough of my day, so here i am, plopping my consciousness down unfiltered onto your screen…

**it’s 8:30 am right now** and i just went to bed about 4 hours ago. i missed my first (round of) alarm(s) so i’m scrambling to the bathroom to get ready to go to class. it’s 14.03 [^1] and i could probably get away with not attending lecture, but i really like the topics of the class and i’ve been trying to get out of the habit of skipping class, so i walk to stata. i pick up a coffee on the way, and down half of it in one big chug.

**it’s 11:30 am right now** and i’m scribbling “these are fascinating questions of urban economics -- look into this” on my notepage for 11.001 [^2] as my professor talks about shopping centers and urban environments and catchment areas. i also love this class, but i know i’m never actually going to look more into these topics because i'm never going to find the time. when the weekend rolls around, all i’m going to want to do is aggressively relax. i probably deserve the rest -- but then when will i ever have the chance to explore the (hard) things i want to do?

**it’s 12:30 pm right now** and there’s a fork in my hand and roasted peppers in my mouth. i’m finally eating vegetables today, and i think of my mom -- of when i was living at home and she lovingly (and strictly) forced me into making my bed and cleaning my room and eating healthy. i hope i can call her today.

**it’s 2:50 pm right now** and i decide to skip 6.006 [^3] recitation. recitation is helpful, and i told myself i’d start going more regularly, but i skipped yesterday’s lecture because i woke up late and had to get lunch before a midterm, so i would just be lost during recitation anyway. plus i had to resolve some last-minute issues with my code for my position as a SERC Scholar researching algorithmic redistricting. i hate the process of flailing around, searching the internet for ways to solve obscure issues in code setups -- it makes me feel like im incompetent and like im wasting away my time. but that's what i have to do. i open up another stackoverflow page.

**it’s 5 pm right now** and i ended up solving what had been tripping me up on my SERC work but a new problem materialized right after it. i couldn’t figure it out with my supervisor during our meeting (that just ended), so it’s going to be my task for this coming week. i walk back with a friend of mine on the same research project and we catch up. it’s fun.

**it’s 5:15 pm right now** and i get off the elevator on Burton Third. i walk into my suite and jump into a passionate conversation between two of my friends. (it's about relationships so there's not much i can contribute but i sit there anyway). then i walk around my floor, stopping by all the freshman suites, saying hi to everybody and asking how their day has been. there’s something about being on floor that’s so calming, and i love it. i forget to call my parents though.

**it’s 6 pm right now** and i start working again. i settle into the couch in the 354 and start typing up my short-answer responses to a GIS assignment i’d worked on earlier in the day. 

**it’s 7 pm right now** and i’ve wrangled together my floor chairs and some other people to finalize details for my floor’s Campus Preview Weekend programming. i’m not the only one who’s hosed right now, and the floor’s planning has definitely fallen through the cracks. since i’m CPW and REX chair for BC, though, i’ve been able to help out more directly for floor events, and crisis seems to be averted.

**it’s 8:30 pm right now** and the glorious Burton Conner House government is providing me with dinner. the floor chairs and exec are having their biweekly meeting, and i’ve popped into the tv lounge because i have some cpw information to share and i want to be updated on some information regarding recent COD action against my floor. we talk about a lot of things, and when we get to the stuff regarding muraling and CODing, it feels really sad. we’re fighting so hard to preserve decades-old floor culture but it doesn’t seem like there’s much we can do against really rigid admin at MIT[^4]. we still make some plans, though.

**it’s 9:45 pm right now** and i’m still sitting in the TV lounge reading court cases for 11.067[^5] class tomorrow. 11.067 is dope as shit, but reading through Supreme Court rulings and dissents and mapping out legal theory is pretty hard and has a non-negotiable time commitment. i try to fit bits and pieces in little stretches of down time during the day, but i still have a lot to get through before tomorrow. i've opted to not take formal notes today and instead just generally read/skim/annotate the rulings. i have many questions on my mind (because constitutional law is weird) but can’t dive too deep into the nuance right now because i don’t quite have the time for it.

**it’s 11:41 pm right now** and i’ve started writing a blog post. i look at my google calendar and think about all the work i have left to do. i have to catch up on the 6.006 lecture i missed, type up the pset for it that’s due tomorrow, and skim through some of the AI safety readings i missed from last week’s reading group. and not skip any classes, because that just messes things up more. all in 24 hours. oh, and hopefully get some sleep… but at least i've written a blog. 

[^1]: Microeconomic Theory and Public Policy
[^2]: Introduction to Urban Design and Development
[^3]: Now called, 6.1210, Introduction to Algorithms
[^4]: This isn’t to say admin at MIT is *all* rigid, however. I really appreciate a lot of what MIT does for us -- it’s so much better than many other institutions -- but I wish it would improve on certain things as well.
[^5]: Land-Use Law and Politics
