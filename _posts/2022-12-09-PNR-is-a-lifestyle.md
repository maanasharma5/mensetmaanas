recently i've been really grateful for PNR [^1], but i feel kind of shitty about the way i've taken advantage of it. PNR was created to help ease freshmen ease into the difficulty of MIT -- any failed classes have no repercussions and letter grades can't bring your GPA down --  but i've felt really quite "well-prepared" for mit. by this i mean that i had the immense of privilege with coming in with credit for some of the GIRs and having experience with some of the classes im taking right now (like multivariable calculus, discrete math, and chemistry), which has made them much easier than they would be otherwise. of course, i think every mit student is capable of doing well at mit, i just know that i've had less of an uphill climb this semester. as a result, i've been able to enjoy PNR without any of the all-so-common crises about passing a class and instead use it to ignore a pset when i'd rather not do it.

this practice of mine of really ballooned ever since coming back from thanksgiving break. i was able to go home and visit my family -- which was a really great and relaxing experience. i played with my dog a bunch, watched tv for hours on end without ever thinking about a pset, and had the best food in the world courtesy of my mom, grandma, and my dad driving us to my favorite restaurants. however, when i came back, *all* of my motivation seeped away quicker than DFW airport shuts down whenever it starts to snow [^2]. the sea of work that awaited me was unimaginably daunting, and ... i had no reason to do it. all i needed was a "P" and i believed that i could achieve that no matter what. so, in the weeks since, i completely stopped attending 5.111[^3] lecture. i knew that i'd learned (most of) the content in ap chem and that i could satisfactorily cram the material in the night before an exam. i haven't even read the lecture notes for the 6.042[^4] classes i'd missed. 

i don't think these will cause me any trouble (touch wood), but i'm sad that i'm not making time for content that i actually find really interesting (there's a reason i pursued them during high school) but alas. i think the only thing i can really hope for is that i have better discipline next semester, when i'll actually have grades and am taking completely new classes! i think only then i wil realize that mit indeed is as hard as everybody says it is.

but until then ... i'll continue to avoid this pset.

[^1]: the first-semester freshman grading scheme that makes any failed classes disappear and letter grades be morphed into a single indiscriminate "P" for pass
[^2]: this is a particularly bad aviation joke but ... whatever
[^3]: principles of chemistry
[^4]: mathematics for computer science (discrete math). renamed 6.1200 that is confusingly pronounced "six-one-twenty".
