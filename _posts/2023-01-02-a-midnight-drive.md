*It’s just shy of 11 PM. The friends have been hugged and the relatives’ feet have been touched. I hop in the car and my parents in a rickshaw. My uncle asks which route we want to take; my cousin chimes in before me. We take the scenic route. We predict that my parents take the quicker one.*

*My uncle rolls the windows down. I want to look out -- at the food stalls and the couples on motorcycles and the old architecture I love so much -- but the dust stings my eyes. I close them; the dust fades away as the wind continues to lap at my face. My uncle accelerates to enter the newly constructed overpass. My eyes are still closed but my ears are empty with a rare silence -- pierced only by the whoosh of cars speeding past on the other side. The wind is cold; I move my face away from the window. A motorcycle honks. The overpass comes back down and the car slows down. More cars honk.*

*I open my eyes and the dust comes striking back. Again, my uncle starts weaving the car in and out of traffic. We arrive back home; my parents’ rickshaw is not yet there.*

*And then I write.*


I thought a lot in these fifteen minutes. At first, I was reminded of home: cars in a suburbia that is long gone now in college. I never liked driving, but riding late at night with my closest friends brought me joy like nothing else. We’d sit laughing like Emma Watson did in _The Perks of Being a Wallflower_, swearing that “we were infinite.” But friends moved away, and the infinite was unveiled as finite. We’re okay with it though, because we know it’s something we have to do.

But then I thought more deeply too. I think that the ride was analogous to how I spent my first semester at MIT: just coasting. I’d closed my eyes to avoid the dust and the difficult navigation and instead revel in the bliss of ignorance. I let internship opportunities pass by. I (continue to) endlessly “procrastinate” working on my policy journal. I even failed to take the initiative to book important medical appointments and call back home enough. But it didn’t bring me crashing down: the preexisting path determined by the overpass is safe enough to allow me to coast safely.

But the dangerous part is the noise of the cars zooming by. When you close your eyes, it sounds like you’re the one speeding past the others. But this is a lie. In reality we’re going just as slow (or as fast) as the cars ahead of you; the cars on the other side are going just as fast (or as slow) in a different direction. In fact, they might have their eyes closed too. How do we know where we’re going? Who's choosing the direction?

I need to open my eyes, chart my own course. Sure, the dust stings my eyes and my anxiety peaks driving around the traffic, but it’s the only way to get places. Eventually, you have to stop coasting, and make the infinite finite.

All this said, I’m not too worried. It’s okay to take breaks sometime, as long as you can come back swinging on the other side. After all, in the end, I ended up reaching home before my parents even though they took the shorter route.
