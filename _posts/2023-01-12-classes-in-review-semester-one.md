Earlier today[^1], I checked Websis to see if my classes had released grades[^2] and I realized that I should write the classic, straightforward “What Classes I Took This Semester” blog post. Generally, I really enjoyed all my classes this semester, but I’ll go into more detail below!

**Prior Credit**
These aren’t exactly classes that I *took* this semester, but they show up on this semester’s grade report and it’s pretty important information to include so I’m including it anyway.

Through AP tests, I received credit for 18.01 (Single-variable Calculus) and 8.01 (Physics: Mechanics). I also received credit via ASE [^3] for 8.02 (Physics: Electricity and Magnetism)

**5.111 (Principles of Chemical Science)**
5.111 is one of two options that fulfills the Chemistry GIR credit. I had originally registered for the other, 3.091 (Introduction to Solid-State Chemistry), but switched to 5.111 the second week of class (even though I had attended no classes for 3.091). I had a gut feeling that I’d do much better with the teaching format of 5.111 -- weekly problem sets, unit tests, etc. -- than 3.091’s -- biweekly quizzes with no problem sets. Additionally, I had prior experience with standard general chemistry in high school while 3.091’s content would be entirely new for me. 

I definitely think I made the right choice by switching. First, I heard mixed reviews about the new 3.091 head professor’s teaching [^4]. More importantly, though, I felt like the content aligned quite well with my AP Chem experience, which made studying easier even if I allegedly skipped more lectures than I should have. Overall, 5.111 just kinda ~was~ -- I don’t feel like I thought much about the class positively or negatively this semester.

**18.022 (Multivariable Calculus)**
I *loved* this class. First of all, I love calculus, and second, the teaching staff was amazing. Professor Borodin is a clear and engaging and unconsciously *funny* lecturer; my TA was a gem who stretched our theoretical skills, answered questions clearly, and whose love for math was infectious; and grading was clear, quick, and lenient. Finally, because class was smaller than 18.02 – just around 40-50 – I got to know a lot of new cool people through the class.

18.022 is technically the theoretical/advanced version of 18.02, standard multivariable calculus, but I think it was much less hurtful than the other .xx2s that some of my friends were in (e.g. 8.012 and 5.112). Lectures were primarily theoretical and did include a lot of proofs (which I loved), but problem sets were straight from the textbook and therefore primarily computational. Tests were very similar to problem sets and had adequate preparation material. Since I had prior experience with multivariable calculus, I’d just skim the textbook if anything included on the psets wasn’t in lecture. The course was also supposed to have some additional material on differential forms at the end, but Professor Borodin got sick and I got a concussion so I didn’t actually learn that fun stuff which makes me a bit sad. 

**11.002 (Making Public Policy)**
This class was my first-choice CI-H[^5] because I love public policy and this fulfills requirements for the minor I am considering. The class was organized around a series of case studies –- some I’d explored deeply before and some that were relatively new for me -- and I thought that Professor Campbell was a great lecturer and genuinely kind teacher. I’m excited to hopefully take more classes with her in the future. (If you like cute cat pictures, I’d recommend her in particular.)[^6]

As a CI-H, we wrote a series of essays in the class – analyses of the policies we were discussing. I enjoyed the research behind the essays, but I found myself wanting to write sprawling essays rather than the precise analysis required by the prompt. As a result, I’d often have to spend additional unnecessary hours at the end paring my essay down. On a similar thread, at the beginning of the year I would close read every single assigned reading rather than reading through them strategically. Overcoming these instincts was an important lesson for me in my continuing academic career. (TLDR: you have to optimize effort/output even if you love something.)

**6.1200 [6.042] (Mathematics for Computer Science)**
I came into this class with quite a bit of discrete math knowledge, so most of this class was review for me. Indeed, the posted lecture notes and the occasional mandatory recitation was enough for me. Overall, I thought that the grading policy was very fair and transparent -- probably the best of my classes this semester. I did try to attend class if Professor was lecturing -- I tried to learn from his teaching style bringing in intuition, good examples, and humor. I hope I can TA or LA or whatever for 042 sometime in the future – I really enjoy the content and think it’s a pretty well-taught class.

**6.100B [6.0002] (Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science)**
6.100B is the second half of the introductory computer science course; the first half is occupied by 6.100A [6.0001] for which I received ASE credit. 6.100B doesn’t fulfill any requirements for majors I’m considering but I took this class because I was really interested in learning more data science skills and it fit in the last six units of my freshman credit limit. However, I feel like the material was presented in the abstract and I didn’t necessarily get all the data science experience I hoped to. Also, this was my first experience with a computer science class taught through powerpoint slides which … let’s just say I’m not a fan. I’m sure there will be future classes taught in this same way so let’s see how I feel about those.

**11.100 (Introduction to Computational Thinking in Cities)**
11.100 is a 3-unit seminar class that was also one of my favorite classes. Dare I say I learned the most in this class this semester, even though we only met for one hour a week and watched a one-hour lecture before each one. 

The class followed a lecture series organized by the professor, Andres, that generally discussed how urban science informs urban design but featured topics from Soviet planning practices to generative design. Because this was my first ever class in urban planning, each one of these topics was entirely new to me, but Andres and my other classmates helped me learn so much about each and every one. This class 100% got me more interested in Course 11, and I’m planning to take 11.001 (Introduction to Urban Design) with Andres next semester as well.


[^1]: I started this blog post when this statement made more sense (like a week after finals ended) but I was on vacation and sick and what have you so this is only getting posted now
[^2]:Although freshmen don’t actually have grades, I just wanted to ensure I hadn’t somehow gotten a zero on any final or anything.
[^3]: Advanced Standing Exams
[^4]: In particular, folks complained about her strictness in lecture and a change in test style midway through the class that drastically lowered average scores. Don’t necessarily make any judgements about the class or teaching because of what I say, though – it was a nuanced issue and I was neither in the class nor privy to staff meetings.
[^5]: Communication intensive humanities class. Freshmen must take one in their first year.
[^6]: She teaches the class every alternate year, and a professor from Course 11 (Department of Urban Studies and Planning) teaches it the other years. (I have also heard great things about this professor.)
