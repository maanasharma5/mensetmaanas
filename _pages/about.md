According to my first ever blog post, [_mens et maanas_](https://mensetmaanas.com/what-is-mens-et-maanas/) is "my space to talk about MIT and me, other people and me, just me, just MIT, stuff probably only I care about, and anything else I can somehow tie to this name." I hope you can enjoy and share in my words -- this is open to all! As of now, this is definitely not envisioned as a formal venue -- think one step up from tumblr blogs. (Okay, maybe two.)
